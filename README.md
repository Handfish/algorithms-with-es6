# Algorithms with ES6

This is a just a lab to test how it would look classic algorithms written with Ecmascript 6. The code result is incredible, because it resolve a lot of problems that we had when writting Javascript.

The list of Algorithms made by now:

## Math Expressions

Algorithm | Description
--------- | -----------
[fatorial()](/math/fatorial.js) | Fatorial algorithm
[givenSum()](/math/given-sum.js) | Get two numbers in an array that the sum is equal a other number that is passed as second parameter
[permutation()](/math/permutation.js) | Permutation math algorithm
[simpleCombination()](/math/simple-combination.js) | Simple combination algorithm

## Array functions

Algorithm | Description
--------- | -----------
[flatten()](/array/flatten.js) | Flatten an array
[removeFromArr()](/array/remove-from-array.js) | Remove an item from an array
[reorderByIndexes()](/array/reorder-by-indexes.js) | Reorder an array based on other array with indexes
[reverse()](/array/reverse.js) | Reverse an array
